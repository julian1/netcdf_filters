prototype demonstrate end-to-end filter to subset netcdf generation, with streaming 
on prod data.

----
PRIORITY
- tidy xml examples - to be more complete .
- get date correctly encoded
- push the sql projections into the xml. 
- connection pool in the unit tests.
- check integration test IT naming conventions. change test names to ITtimeseries with IT first 

----

WHAT'S DONE

- done get dates correctly encoded  (to enable verificiation of filter date range)
- done sequencing the definition, and data writing phases of netcdf generation 
- done basic subset expression parser/ 
- done postgres dialect rewriter instance
- done netcdf encoder
- done localized convention/ config strategy
- done experimented with a couple of query approaches favor time to start streaming, total time etc. 
- done - write required attributes with strategy
- done - write multiple files (and get the writable instantiation working ) (pass at the time). 
- done-  should specify dimension of a var by name, then we can infer size/count. 
- done - think we have to invert it, instead of trying to infer, use an explicit configuration.
	- It's part of the task.
	- meaning use spring.
- done - mvn project
- done layer configuration into xml file
- done need to be able to select different feature types - and command line arguments
- done take dims from config file.. 
- done - have a timeseries, need a trajectory. failsafe to run a specific integration test... 
- done xml config.
- done factor encoder strategy chooser - so it's not instantiated, or else use property setters instead of constructor for the writer.

TODO

- organize project sources
- add support to parser/expr for geometry for spatial constraint choice
- config to specify the tables.
- compose with spring
-  (cant but have abstracted out) do the netcdf generation in memory

- pass table as paraemter to encoder strategy (not sure)
- make a tomcat/http service/ 

- postgres - parametize query parameters, rather than use text

- need time,lat,lon
- zip the file stream
